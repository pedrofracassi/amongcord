## Self-hosting

If you prefer you run the bot yourself instead of using the [hosted instance](https://amongcord.pedrofracassi.me/add), you can either use **Docker** or **clone the repository directly**. For both methods, you'll need a  [bot token](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) and the ID of a server that has the [emojis the bot needs](https://github.com/pedrofracassi/amongcord/tree/master/emojis) (the bot needs to be in the server).

### Docker

Images are automatically built and pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/pedrofracassi/amongcord) whenever the source code changes. You can run your own instance of the bot with the command below:

```bash
$ docker run -e DISCORD_TOKEN=<your discord token> GUILD_ID=<emoji guild id> -d pedrofracassi/amongcord
```

### Cloning directly

Although not recommended for production, cloning the repository should work just fine for experimental purposes. If you want to, you can use a process manager like [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to keep the node process running, but bear in mind that **I don't run the bot this way and probably won't be able to help you out.**

1. Clone the repository
   > `git clone https://github.com/pedrofracassi/amongcord`
2. Enter the directory you just cloned into
   > `cd amongcord`
3. Install the dependencies
   > `npm install`
4. Set the **DISCORD_TOKEN** and **GUILD_ID** environment variables in a file called `.env`, which is located in the Root-Directory of the project.
5. Run the bot
   > `node src/.`


## Similar projects

- [AmongUsBot](https://github.com/alpharaoh/AmongUsBot) - automatically detects tasks/discussion stages with OCR instead of using commands, but needs to be installed on someone's computer.
- [amongusdiscord](https://github.com/denverquane/amongusdiscord) - same as above, but written in Go. Easier to install as prebuilt executables are provided.
